## TODO ##
- Add support for multiple platforms (doubly linked list, make a seperate PlatformList singleton class)
- Add back gravity (need methods to check if on platform)
- rewrite setOnGround
- clean up unused classes/methods (ground, etc.)
- use requestAnimation method
- move generateTerrain into PlatformList class

At this point, the basic wireframe running should be nearly complete

Next: guns + enemies
